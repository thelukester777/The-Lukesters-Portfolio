<h2>Code Examples</h2>
<p>I've been working in web development since 2007. I started out designing assets and writing HTML for weekly promotional emails, landing pages, and banners at a company called Calumet Photographic. It taught me a lot about writing semantic code that degrades gracefully. You can see some photos of the content I built on the <a href="javascript:" title="Design" data-link="design">Design</a> page of this site.</p>
<p>After leaving Calumet Photo, I started at Sears Holdings Corporation as a Front End Web Developer. I learned how to write JavaScript and helped my team develop a core library of functions to use for our various common modules and patterns. I worked my way up to a management position and now lead a team of Front End Devs. We are constantly working and learning about new processes and development best practices together.</p>
<p>Below are just a few snippets of some jQuery I've written for this website. While this definitly does not cover the vast ammount of coding I've done over the years, it should give a rough idea of my abilities. See for yourself!</p>
<hr>
<h3>'data-link' Attribute</h3>
<p>This is actually the main function for this website. You can see it's very simple and just swaps the content based on the ID of each section. It does this by finding a matching 'data-link' attribute on the anchor tags. Rather than have many indivdual pages to link to and keep track of, I kept everything in one HTML document. It might not be great for SEO, but it makes it easy to edit/interact with. Very minimal pagenation. Very simple jQuery function.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = $(<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>), <span class="hljs-comment">// Assign a variable to DOM Selectors.</span>
    cN = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// Hoist the variable to make more global.</span>
    mN = $(<span class="hljs-string">'.main'</span>),
    nV = $(<span class="hljs-string">'nav, header'</span>);

$(a).click(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> cN = $(<span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>).attr(<span class="hljs-string">'data-link'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Assigns 'data-link' attribute3 as class.</span>
    $(mN).hide(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Hides the default class so that it can be replaced.</span>
    $(<span class="hljs-string">'#'</span> + cN).fadeIn(<span class="hljs-string">'slow'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Uses new attribute and creats ID selector.</span>
    $(nV).removeClass().addClass(cN); <span class="hljs-comment">// Swaps navs for each page with selector.</span>
});

</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Check Query String</h3>
<p>This is also a snippet from this website. I use this function to retrieve the query string params. I use them for various admin purposes as well as defining which content should show once user navigates from another page, like the "Thank You" page.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
<span class="hljs-comment">// Query String Fn</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pU = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
    pP = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>,
    pN = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">getUrlParams</span>(<span class="hljs-params">q</span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// Fetches the value of a URL query param.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pU = <span class="hljs-built_in">window</span>.location.search.substring(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>),
    pP = pU.split(<span class="hljs-string">'&amp;'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; pP.length; i++) { <span class="hljs-comment">//Loop through URL query string</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> pN = pP[i].split(<span class="hljs-string">'='</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (pN[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] == q) { <span class="hljs-comment">// Checks the param name(s)</span>
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> pN[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns the param value</span>
        }
    }
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// Initiates the function.</span>
getUrlParams();

<span class="hljs-comment">// Alternate way to initiate and return the value 'design' from '?page=design'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> page = getUrlParams(<span class="hljs-string">'page'</span>); 

</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Ajax Request</h3>
<p>Working on an ecommerce website, you work with many API's. Whether you are looking at services for profile information, shopping cart, product information, or working with 3rd party data, it helps to know how to utilize and manipulate that information. Using Ajax is pretty standard.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs javascript">
$.ajax({
    <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'https://thelukester777.github.io/portfolio/some/fake/server/database/get'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// Not Real :)</span>
    dataType: <span class="hljs-string">'json'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// We want the data to come in JSON format.</span>
    success: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// If the request goes through successfully, continue.</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Takes data, assigns variable to container and parses</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c1 = $(<span class="hljs-string">'.container-one'</span>), <span class="hljs-comment">// Assigns container.</span>
            c2 = $(<span class="hljs-string">'.container-two'</span>);
        $(c1).append(data.valueOne); <span class="hljs-comment">// Appends value 'valueOne' to '.container-one'</span>
        $(c2).append(data.valueTwo);
        <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'Dev note: Data loaded successfully!'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Console log to show successful data load.</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-attr">error</span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError</span>) </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">// Error handling.</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (xhr.status === <span class="hljs-number">404</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// If the API 404 errors, you may be able to resolve. So log it.</span>
                    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'Dev note: '</span> + xhr.status + <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> + xhr.statusText + <span class="hljs-string">'. data not loaded.'</span>);
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (xhr.status !== <span class="hljs-number">404</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// If it's not 404ing, it might be something else with service. </span>
                    <span class="hljs-built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="hljs-string">'Dev note: '</span> + xhr.status + <span class="hljs-string">' '</span> + xhr.statusText + <span class="hljs-string">'. Check API status.'</span>);
        }
    }
});

<h2>Web Design Portfolio</h2>
<h3>Calumet Photographic</h3>
<p>Calumet was my first job out of college. It started as a part time internship which turned into an FTE position as a Web Designer. I learned the basics of writing HTML and CSS, as well as honed my design capabilities by developing templates for email campaigns, landing pages, banners, and other web content. I worked closely with copywriters and back-end developers to cover every area of all four Calumet websites.</p>

<img src="https://thelukester777.github.io/portfolio/images/calumet-enews.png" alt="Calumet Enews">
<h3>Emails &amp; eBlasts</h3>
<p>I was responsible for creating our eBlast template that we sent out weekly to our 4 main email lists in the US, UK, Germany, and Netherlands. Every week, I designed and coded the eBlasts for the UK and Netherlands, while one of my fellow designers handled the US and Germany. We worked closely together to align on design techniquies and best practices, as well as maintained a solid HTML template that was compliant in almost every email application. We had a "Photo of the Week" contest in which members or our site could submit their photos to be featured within these emails, as well as our Homepages.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Landing Pages &amp; Banners</h3>
<p>As a Designer, I was responsible for the integrity of the look and feel of our websites. However, I was also able to practice writing code by creating landing pages for various promotions and events. I worked closely with our development team to write HTML and CSS as semantically as possible. This sparked my interest in coding, and enabled me to learn a very valuable new skill-set. I continued to design and code pages until my departure from the company in 2010.</p>

<h2>Welcome, friend!</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Luke—a working class web developer in the great city of Chicago, Illinois. This part of the site features illustration work I've done over the years. Feel free to click around the navigation to explore the site!</p>
<p><strong>A little about me:</strong> I studied 3D Modeling, Animation, Illustration, Digital Design, and more at 'The American Academy of Art.' It was there I honed my artisitc ability and wet my apetite for the commercial arts. After graduating, I cut my teeth as a developer at a small photography company. I've been at it ever since. Today, I hold a great deal of industry experience after working in ecommerce for close to a decade.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, I'm spending time with my family and friends. I'm a big fan of the outdoors and enjoy camping, hiking, kayaking, and hanging out in backyards. I stay busy by working on home projects and keeping up with my son, Vincent.</p>

<h2>"Faces" - 2009</h2>
<p>'Faces' is about not smiling. It represents the silly twisted faces people make when they aren't in the mood to pose for the camera. People in these moments typically reveal something you just don't get by telling them to "Say cheese!" I used the opportunity to play with light reflection and hunted for color combinations that compliment the mood of their expressions. While trying to keep them somewhat photo-realisitic—I amped up colors and warped features slightly to get a more animated look.</p>

<h2>"The Alley Stores" - 2006-2007</h2>
<p>While in college, I worked at The Alley stores, a popular punk-rock/ metal haven for buying alternative clothing and accessories. Over the course of a year, I designed over 50 t-shirt logos and even helped print a great deal of them. It was a very fun job and it was the first time I considered myself a commercial artist.</p>

<section id="dream" class="main hide image">
<img src="https://thelukester777.github.io/portfolio/images/dream.png" alt="Dare to Dream">
<h2>"Dare to Dream" - 2013</h2>
<p>I got the idea for this after seeing a news bit about a turtle that had been tied to the end of a weather balloon. I was inspired to make this cruel story more light hearted. I decided that instead to portray a turtle who has always dreamed of flying, and now has reached his dream.</p>

<h2>"Octopi Your Mind" - 2014</h2>
<p>I was inspired by seeing a few drawings of octopi, and I thought it would be really fun to try creating my own version of one. I kept layering textures and playing with various colors until I got the array just right. It lacks a bit in technicality, but the colors are what makes this one special to me.</p>

<h2>"Sea Floor Fight" - 2014</h2>
<p>This was a fun idea I had shortly after re-touching the "Optopi Your Mind" piece. I was challeneged by a friend to start drawing again, so I took my sketchbook with me on my commutes for a week and came up with the first draft of this in pencil.</p>

<h2>"Self Portrait" - 2006</h2>
<p>This was one of the pieces in my senior gallery showing before graduating college. These days it looks a bit crude, but is still a very relevant piece to me, considering I learned a great deal about how to illustrate using digital media.</p>
