            <p>Hello, I'm Luke—a working class web developer in the great city of Chicago, Illinois. Feel free to click around the navigation to explore the site!</p>
            <p><strong>A little about me:</strong> I studied 3D Modeling, Animation, Illustration, Digital Design, and more at 'The American Academy of Art.' It was there I honed my artisitc ability and wet my apetite for the commercial arts. After graduating, I cut my teeth as a developer at a small photography company. I've been at it ever since. Today, I hold a great deal of industry experience after working in ecommerce for over decade.</p>

                <h2>Sears Holdings Corporation</h2>
                <p>At SHC, I started out as a Junior Web Developer, worked my way up to Senior Web Developer, and then finally became a Web Development Manager in 2014. During this time period, I worked with many different people on various teams throughout the organization to develop everything from simple web banners, to full-fledged web applications.</p>
                <p>We utilized lots of software and web dev technology to fullfill the needs of project stakeholders. It was a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment, with lots of creative and passionate people from all walks of life.</p>

                <p class="sears-wide">Just starting out at the company, my team was responsible for hard-coding content on the Sears and Kmart websites. We worked closely with the online-marketing team, as well as web designers to create promotional banners, landing pages, and social media campaigns. There were many challenges at this time, as we had not yet found a CMS capable of handling the volume of requests in an efficient way. We had daily promotional changes on each of the various categories from all business-unit stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="sears-wide">After gaining the title of Senior Web Developer, working on more advanced long-term projects, and developing a great rapport with my colleages, I took a leadership role and became a Manager. I helped in the decision-making process for the technology stacks implmented on our websites, established project timeframes, estimated budget costs, identified the appropriate resources and skillsets required for us to work as efficiently as possible. During this time, I helped implement, and support the Adobe Experience Manager CMS to streamline process.</p>

                <h2>Calumet Photographic</h2>
                <p>Calumet was my first job out of college. It started as a part time internship which turned into an full-time position as a Web Designer. I was not only able to hone my design capabilities by developing templates for email campaigns, landing pages, banners, and other web content, I was also able to learn the basics of writing HTML and CSS. I worked closely with copywriters and back-end developers to design and currate content for the American, British, Dutch, and German versions of our website.</p>

                <p>I was responsible for creating our eBlast template that we sent out weekly to our 4 main email lists in the US, UK, Germany, and Netherlands. Every week, I designed and coded the eBlasts for the UK and Netherlands, while one of my fellow designers handled the US and Germany. We worked closely together to align on design techniquies and best practices, as well as maintained a solid HTML template that was compliant in almost every email application. We had a "Photo of the Week" contest in which members or our site could submit their photos to be featured within these emails, as well as our Homepages.</p>

                <p>As a Designer, I was responsible for the integrity of the look and feel of our websites. However, I was also able to practice writing code by creating landing pages for various promotions and events. I worked closely with our development team to write HTML and CSS as semantically as possible. This sparked my interest in coding, and enabled me to learn a very valuable new skill-set. I continued to design and code pages until my departure from the company in 2010.</p>

            <h2>"Faces" - 2009</h2>
            <p>'Faces' is about not smiling. It represents the silly twisted faces people make when they aren't in the mood to pose for the camera. People in these moments typically reveal something you just don't get by telling them to "Say cheese!" I used the opportunity to play with light reflection and hunted for color combinations that compliment the mood of their expressions. While trying to keep them somewhat photo-realisitic—I amped up colors and warped features slightly to get a more animated look.</p>

            <p>While in college, I worked at The Alley stores, a popular punk-rock/ metal haven for buying alternative clothing and accessories. Over the course of a year, I designed over 50 t-shirt logos and even helped print a great deal of them. It was a very fun job and it was the first time I considered myself a commercial artist.</p>

            <h2>"Dare to Dream" - 2013</h2>
            <p>I got the idea for this after seeing a news bit about a turtle that had been tied to the end of a weather balloon. I was inspired to make this cruel story more light hearted. I decided that instead to portray a turtle who has always dreamed of flying, and now has reached his dream.</p>

            <h2>"Octopi Your Mind" - 2014</h2>
            <p>I was inspired by seeing a few drawings of octopi, and I thought it would be really fun to try creating my own version of one. I kept layering textures and playing with various colors until I got the array just right. It lacks a bit in technicality, but the colors are what makes this one special to me.</p>

            <h2>"Sea Floor Fight" - 2014</h2>
            <p>This was a fun idea I had shortly after re-touching the "Optopi Your Mind" piece. I was challeneged by a friend to start drawing again, so I took my sketchbook with me on my commutes for a week and came up with the first draft of this in pencil.</p>

            <h2>"Self Portrait" - 2006</h2>
            <p>This was one of the pieces in my senior gallery showing before graduating college. These days it looks a bit crude, but is still a very relevant piece to me, considering I learned a great deal about how to illustrate using digital media.</p>
